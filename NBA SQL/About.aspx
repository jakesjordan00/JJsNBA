    <h2 >About the purpose of this project</h2>
    <p>This web application was made to provide a streamlined, easy to use interface for executing queries on current NBA players, teams and games.</p>

    
        <p>If I'm being honest... This started with wanting to research the Pelicans advanced lineup statistics for a video.

            <br />
            And then I spent two hours making this intro and never actually made the video
            <br />
            <video width="720 " height="405" controls src="1.mp4">
                
                  </video>
            <br />
            and from there I started down the path that led towards this website
        </p>
